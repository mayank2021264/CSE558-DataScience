## Assignment 1

### Overview
The first assignment focuses on data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and probability-based simulations. It is divided into the following tasks:

1. **Dataset Analysis (Auto MPG)**:
   - Preprocessing: One-hot encoding and integer mapping.
   - Statistical Computation: Mean and variance calculation.
   - Normalization and variance computation.
   - Hypothesis testing on the relationship between features.

2. **Population Variance**:
   - Calculate true variance for a uniformly distributed dataset.
   - Sampling and variance estimation using multiple methods.
   - Visualize convergence of sample variance to population variance.

3. **Probability Problems**:
   - Expected rolls for specific outcomes using unbiased and biased dice.
   - Implement a program to analyze rolls as the number of faces increases.

4. **Hurricane Dataset**:
   - Conduct statistical tests for correlation and distribution analysis.
   - Hypothesis testing for feature dependence.

### Contents
- **Code Files**: Python scripts for each task.
- **Plots**: Visualizations of the results.
- **Documentation**: Detailed steps and assumptions used in the solutions.

## Assignment 2

### Overview
The second assignment focuses on hash functions, data estimation, and random projection methods. It includes the following tasks:

1. **Hash Functions**:
   - Implement a universal hash function.
   - Experiment with hash functions on a word dataset.
   - Analyze chain lengths and compare hash function performance.
   - Use the Flajolet-Martin algorithm for unique word estimation.

2. **Random Projection**:
   - Apply random projection to the KDD Cup dataset.
   - Perform k-means clustering and compare results with original data.
   - Conduct linear regression using a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss matrix.

### Contents
- **Code Files**: Python scripts implementing the solutions.
- **Plots and Tables**: Visual representation of experimental results.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of methods and findings.
